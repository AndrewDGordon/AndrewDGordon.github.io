# Andrew D. Gordon

[Andrew D. Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-d-gordon/) is a computer scientist specializing in programming languages, AI, and human-computer interaction.
Andy is Science Advisor at London startup [Cogna](https://cogna.co)
where he leads research on [delivering software from natural language](https://icfp24.sigplan.org/details/icfp-2024-papers/36/Requirements-are-All-You-Need),
and is Science Advisor at the [Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)](https://www.aria.org.uk/).
Before joining Cogna as an early employee in 2023, Andy had a 26 year career at Microsoft Research.
As Partner Research Manager, Andy led a diverse team of researchers and engineers to evolve Excel as an end-user programming language.
He made significant contributions to the development of
[natural language formulas using generative AI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544548.3580817) in [Copilot for Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-excel),
formula features like [LET/LAMBDA](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6759611720181907456/),
the [Calc.ts client-side execution engine for Excel formulas](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6688489472960544768/),
and [Excel Labs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/profiles/excel-labs/).
Andy was recognised as a [2020 Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery](https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/gordon_N026872) (ACM) for his research on programming languages:
their principles, logic, usability, and trustworthiness.
Andy is now Honorary Professor at the University of Edinburgh, following 12 years as full Professor.
His PhD research at Cambridge contributed to the design of monadic I/O in Haskell, with his [ASCII art ">>="](https://twitter.com/AndrewDGordon/status/1559448300134211584) inspiring the Haskell logo.
During his postdoc at Chalmers University he pioneered use of the [locally nameless representation](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2009/ln/main.pdf) in formal proofs.
